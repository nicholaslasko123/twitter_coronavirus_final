# **Twitter Coronavirus Analysis**

## **Overview**
This project analyzes geotagged Twitter data from 2020 to track COVID-19 discussions on social media. It processes billions of tweets to uncover insights on hashtag usage by language and country. The analysis generates visualizations that highlight trends across different locations and languages.

## **Key Objectives**
- **Process large-scale datasets** using MapReduce  
- **Analyze multilingual text data**  
- **Track hashtag trends**  
- **Visualize insights** using Matplotlib  

## **Dataset**
The dataset consists of 1.1 billion tweets, extracted from daily zip files containing geotagged information.

## **Methodology**
1. **Mapping:** Extracts hashtags from each tweet and counts occurrences by language and country.  
2. **Reducing:** Aggregates hashtag counts across all tweets.  
3. **Visualization:** Generates bar graphs to show hashtag usage by country and language.  

## **Results**
The analysis produced the following key visualizations:
